```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Preparation

### Download file

```
fileTrainUrl <- c("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")
fileTestingUrl <- c("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")

download.file(fileTrainUrl, c("/dev/shm/foo"), "wget", quiet = FALSE, mode = "w",
              cacheOK = TRUE,
              extra = getOption("download.file.extra"))

training <- read.csv("/home/larsbun/temp/rpr/foo")

download.file(fileTestingUrl, c("/dev/shm/bar"), "wget", quiet = FALSE, mode = "w",
              cacheOK = TRUE,
              extra = getOption("download.file.extra"))

testing <- read.csv("/home/larsbun/temp/rpr/bar")              
```
### Select colums

First find the number of NA values in each column:
```
na_count <-sapply(training, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y)))))
```
Remove columns that are mostly NA
```
training <- training[,na_count < 19216]
```
And do the same thing for the test set:
```
testing <- testing[,na_count < 19216]
```

Now filter out nsvs:

```
nsv<-nearZeroVar(training, saveMetrics=TRUE)
training <- training[,-(nsv$zeroVar | nsv$nzv)]
testing <- testing[,-(nsv$zeroVar | nsv$nzv)]
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
